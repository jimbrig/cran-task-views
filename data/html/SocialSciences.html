        Social scientists use a wide range of statistical methods, most of which are not unique to the social sciences. Indeed, most statistical data analysis in the social sciences is covered by the facilities in the base and recommended packages, which are part of the standard R distribution. In the package descriptions below, I identify base and recommended packages on first mention; packages that are not specifically identified as &quot;R-base&quot; or &quot;recommended&quot; are contributed packages.

        Beyond the base and contributed packages, many of the methods commonly employed in the social sciences are covered extensively in other CRAN task views, including the following.

          Linear and Generalized Linear Models:
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Univariate and multivariate linear models are fit by the
<tt>lm</tt>
        function, generalized linear models by the
<tt>glm</tt>
        function, both in the R-base
        <b>
          stats
        </b>
        package. Beyond
<tt>summary</tt>
        and
<tt>plot</tt>
        methods for
<tt>lm</tt>
        and
<tt>glm</tt>
        objects, there is a wide array of functions that support these objects.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The generic
<tt>anova</tt>
          function in the
          <b>
            stats
          </b>
          package constructs sequential (&quot;Type-I&quot;) analysis of variance and analysis of deviance tables, and can also compute
          <i>
            F
          </i>
          and chisquare likelihood-ratio tests for nested models. (It is typical for other classes of statistical models in R to have
<tt>anova</tt>
          methods as well, along with methods for other standard generics, such as
<tt>coef</tt>, for returning regression coefficients;
<tt>vcov</tt>
          for the coefficient covariance matrix;
<tt>residuals</tt>; and
<tt>fitted</tt>
          for fitted values of the response.) The generic
<tt>Anova</tt>
          function in the
<a href="../packages/car/index.html">car</a>
          package (associated with Fox and Weisberg,
          <i>
            An R Companion to Applied Regression, Second Edition
          </i>, Sage, 2011) constructs so-called &quot;Type-II&quot; and &quot;Type-III&quot; partial tests for linear, generalized linear, and many other classes of regression models.

<tt>waldtest</tt>
          functions in the
<a href="../packages/lmtest/index.html">lmtest</a>
          package, and the
<tt>linearHypothesis</tt>
          function in the
<a href="../packages/car/index.html">car</a>
          package. All of these functions permit the use of heteroscedasticity and heteroscedasticity/autocorrelation-consistent covariance matrices, as computed, e.g., by functions in the
<a href="../packages/sandwich/index.html">sandwich</a>
          and
<a href="../packages/car/index.html">car</a>
          packages. Also see the
<tt>glh.test</tt>
          function in the
<a href="../packages/gmodels/index.html">gmodels</a>
          package. Nonlinear functions of parameters can be tested via the
<tt>deltaMethod</tt>
          function in the
<a href="../packages/car/index.html">car</a>
          package. The
<a href="../packages/multcomp/index.html">multcomp</a>
          package includes functions for multiple comparisons. The
<tt>vuong</tt>
          function in the
<a href="../packages/pscl/index.html">pscl</a>
          package tests non-nested hypotheses for generalized linear and some other models. Also see the
<a href="../packages/rms/index.html">rms</a>
          package for tests on linear and generalized linear models.
        </li>
        <li>
          The standard R distribution has excellent basic facilities for linear and generalized linear model &quot;diagnostics,&quot; including, for example, hat-values and deletion statistics such as studentized residuals and Cook's distances (
<tt>hatvalues</tt>,
<tt>rstudent</tt>, and
<tt>cooks.distance</tt>, all in the
          <b>
            stats
          </b>
          package). These are augmented by other packages: several functions in the
<a href="../packages/car/index.html">car</a>
          package, which emphasizes graphical methods, e.g.,
<tt>crPlots</tt>
          for component-plus-residual plots and
<tt>avPlots</tt>
          for added-variable plots (among others), in addition to numerical diagnostics, such
<tt>vif</tt>
          for (generalized) variance-inflation factors; the
<a href="../packages/dr/index.html">dr</a>
          package for dimension reduction in regression, including SIR, SAVE, and pHd; and the
<a href="../packages/lmtest/index.html">lmtest</a>
          package, which implements a variety of diagnostic tests (e.g., for heteroscedasticity, nonlinearity, and autocorrelation). Other collinearity diagnostics are in the
<a href="../packages/perturb/index.html">perturb</a>
          package. Diagnostics may also be found in the
<a href="../packages/rms/index.html">rms</a>
          package. See the
<a href="../packages/influence.ME/index.html">influence.ME</a>
          package for influential-data diagnostics for mixed-effects models.
        </li>
        <li>
          Several packages contain functions that are useful for interpreting linear and generalized linear models that have been fit to data: The
<a href="../packages/qvcalc/index.html">qvcalc</a>
          packages computes &quot;quasi variances&quot; for factors in linear and generalized linear models (and more generally). The
<a href="../packages/effects/index.html">effects</a>
          package constructs effect displays, including, e.g., &quot;adjusted means,&quot; for linear, generalized linear, and many other regression  models; diagnostic partial-residual plots are available for linear and generalized linear models. Similar, if somewhat less general, plots are available in the
<a href="../packages/visreg/index.html">visreg</a>
          package. The
<a href="../packages/lsmeans/index.html">lsmeans</a>
          implements so-called &quot;least-squares means&quot; for linear, generalized linear, and mixed models, and includes provisions for hypothesis tests. The
<a href="../packages/Zelig/index.html">Zelig</a>
          package (see under
          <a href="#Collections">
            &quot;Collections&quot;
