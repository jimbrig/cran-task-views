      This CRAN task view contains a list of packages that includes
methods typically used in official statistics and survey methodology.
Many packages provide functionality for more than one of the topics listed 
below.  Therefore this list is not a strict categorization and packages can be 
listed more than once. Certain data import/export facilities regarding to often used statistical software tools
like SPSS, SAS or Stata are mentioned in the end of the task view.

  ratios and quantiles for domains or the whole survey sample, and to apply 
  regression models.  Variance estimation for means, totals and ratios can be 
  done either by Taylor linearization or resampling (BRR, jackkife, bootstrap 
  or user-defined).

          Imputation
        </strong>
      </p>
      A distinction between iterative model-based methods, k-nearest neighbor methods 
and miscellaneous methods is made.  However, often the criteria for using a 
method depend on the scale of the data, which in official statistics are 
typically a mixture of continuous, semi-continuous, binary, categorical and 
count variables. In addition, measurement errors may corrupt non-robust imputation methods.
Note that only few imputation methods can deal with mixed types of variables and only few methods account for robustness issues.

        <li>
          The S4 class package
<a href="../packages/CoImp/index.html">CoImp</a>
          imputes multivariate missing data by using conditional copula functions. The imputation procedure is semiparametric: the margins are non-parametrically estimated through local likelihood of low-degree polynomials while a range of different parametric models for the copula can be selected by the user. The missing values are imputed by drawing observations from the conditional density functions by means of the Hit or Miss Monte Carlo method. It works either for a matrix of continuous scaled variables or a matrix of discrete distributions.
